There are two versions of the figure : ABCDFullTex1.tex and ABCDFullTex2.tex
Edit one of them and compile it with pdflatex command.

Then make a shortcut to it in the upper directory using the following command :

rm -rf ../ABCD.pdf
ln -s ABCDFullTex1/2.pdf ../ABCD.pdf

the tdr command inserts the linked file into the PAS.
