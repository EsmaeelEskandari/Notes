\subsection{Estimation of the Tau Leptons}
\label{sect:tau}
Tau leptons can decay hadronically and appear as a thin jet and enter the hadronic searches. 
To estimate the contamination from such events a method similar to what is used for the lost lepton background is used here. The number of 
events with exactly one real tau is corrected by accounting for the reconstruction and acceptance efficiencies. In the other words:
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation}
	N_{W\rightarrow{\tau\nu}} = \frac{N_{\tau}^{reco} - N_{\tau}^{bg}}{\varepsilon_{\tau}},
	\label{eq:TauEstimation}
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath}
where $N_{\tau}^{reco}$ is the number of events with one reconstructed tau, $N_{\tau}^{bg}$ is the number of events with a 
fake tau and $\varepsilon_{\tau}$ denotes the probability for a generated
$W \rightarrow \tau\nu, \ \tau \to had$ event passing the selection cuts to have a reconstructed and identified tau. 
The efficiency $\varepsilon_{\tau}$ is extracted from simulation. In average, $\varepsilon_{\tau}$ is found to be $\sim24$\%. 5\% systematic 
uncertainty is assigned to this value to take into account the differences between data and MC.
The transverse mass (\mt) of the system of the reconstructed tau and MET is forced to be less than 100 GeV/$c^2$ to decrease 
the signal contamination.  The number of events with a fake tau, $N_{\tau}^{bg}$ is found from the MC simulation and a 50\% systematic 
uncertainty is assigned to this value.

The \mttwo distribution of the events with all selection cuts which have an
identified tau in the final state is shown in Figure \ref{fig:MT2Tau}.

Scale factors of the tau selection are not applied and it can be the source of the discrepancies between data and MC.

\end{table}
contribution of different samples in the plot of Figure \ref{fig:MT2Tau} is shown. It can be seen that the statistics in the signal
region is poor. To decrease the uncertainties of the predictions, the cut on  \mindphifour is relaxed. 
The last row of the table shows the statistics after this relaxation. The scale factor to compensate this relaxation is 
read from MC.
