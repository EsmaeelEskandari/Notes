% The date is in yyyy/mm/dd format. Today has been

% For papers and PAS, \today is taken as the date the head file (this one) was last modified according to svn: see the RCS Id string above.

% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. For PASs: **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: CDS MathJax processor used on the abstract doesn't understand them _and_ will only look within $$. The abstracts for papers are hand formatted so macros are okay.
\abstract{
We present the results of the search for $t$-channel single top quark signals in the LHC proton proton collisions at 13\,\TeV with the CMS detector. The leptonic decay channel with a muon in the final state is considered. After a selection optimized for the $t$-channel single top quark production, the pseudorapidity distribution of the recoil jet is exploited for discrimination between signal and background processes. The background from $\qcd$ multijet production is modeled using data driven techniques. %The significance of the signal contribution in the dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $\mylumi$ is about 3 standard deviations. 
%A measurement of the inclusive cross section of $t$-channel single top quark production based on a template fit to the reconstructed pseudorapidity distribution of the  recoil jet yields $\xsecRes$. The magnitude of the CKM matrix element $\vtb$ is also calculated, yielding $\vtbRes$.

% >> PDF Metadata
% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text:
% (1) no TeX! -- for \sqrt{s} use sqrt(s) -- this will show with extra quote marks in the draft version but is okay).
% (2) no %.
% (3) No curly braces {}.
