\section{Conclusion}
\label{sect:conclusion}
A search for SUSY in $\tau\tau$ final state is presented. The $\tau$ pair is produced in a cascade from the production of the \PSGcpDo pair.
Different channels and search bins are introduced to increase the sensitivity to different parts of the phase space. 
The channels with at least one hadronic $\tau$ are studied in this report. The other channels were investigated, but they
do not add any axclusion power to the analysis.
Backgrounds and their systematic uncertainties are discussed in details. 
The expected exclusion limits are also presented for different combination of the 
channels.
{\bf FIXME should be updated when the results are finalized.}
