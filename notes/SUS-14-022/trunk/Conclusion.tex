\section{Conclusion}
\label{sect:conclusion}
We have presented a search for SUSY in the $\tau\tau$ final state where the
$\tau$ pair could be produced in a cascade-decay from a \PSGcpDo pair.
We have used different channels and search regions to increase sensitivity to
different regions of phase space. 
All channels considered have at least one hadronic $\tau$ decay.
We see no excess of events with respect to the SM expectation.
%The other channels were investigated, but they do not add any axclusion power to the analysis.
%Backgrounds and their systematic uncertainties are discussed in details. 
%The expected exclusion limits are also presented for different combination of the channels.
In the context of simplified models, charginos lighter than 410 \GeV when the neutralino mass is zero
are excluded at 95\% confidence level.
