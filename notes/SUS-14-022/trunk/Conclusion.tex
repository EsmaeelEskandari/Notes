\section{Conclusion}
\label{sect:conclusion}
We have presented a search for SUSY in the $\tau\tau$ final state where the
$\tau$ pair could be produced in a cascade decay from a \PSGcpDo pair.
We have used different channels and search regions to increase the sensitivity to
different regions of phase space. 
All channels considered have at least one hadronic $\tau$ decay.
We see no excess of events with respect to the SM expectation.
%The other channels were investigated, but they do not add any axclusion power to the analysis.
%Backgrounds and their systematic uncertainties are discussed in details. 
%The expected exclusion limits are also presented for different combination of the channels.
In the context of simplified models, charginos lighter than 420\GeV 
for a neutralino mass of zero are excluded at 95\% confidence level.
The limits are also provided for the direct stau pair production, but no masses  can be excluded 
even for a massless neutralino.
