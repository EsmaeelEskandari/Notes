\section{Conclusion}
\label{sect:conclusion}
A search for SUSY in the $\tau\tau$ final state where the
$\tau$ pair could be produced in a cascade decay from the electroweak production of \PSGcpDo pair.
We have used different channels and search regions to increase the sensitivity to
different regions of phase space. All channels considered have at least one hadronic $\tau$ decay.
 \mttwo of two leptons is used as a search variable to
distinguish between signal and background. In a special part of the phase space with
a moderate \mttwo, the sum of the transverse mass of two $\tau$ leptons was found to be a
useful variable.
There is no excess of events with respect to the SM expectations.
%The other channels were investigated, but they do not add any axclusion power to the analysis.
%Backgrounds and their systematic uncertainties are discussed in details. 
%The expected exclusion limits are also presented for different combination of the channels.
In the context of simplified models, charginos lighter than 420\GeV 
for a massless neutralino  are excluded at 95\% confidence level.
The limits are also provided for the direct stau pair production, but no masses  can be excluded 
even for a massless neutralino.
