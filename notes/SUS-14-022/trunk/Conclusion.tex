\section{Conclusion}
\label{sect:conclusion}
A search for SUSY in $\tau\tau$ final state is presented. The $\tau$ pair is produced in a cascade from the production of the \PSGcpDo pair.
Different channels and search bins are introduced to increase the sensitivity to different parts of the phase space. 
Backgrounds and their systematics are discussed in details. The expected exclusion limits are also presented for different combination of the 
channels.
{\bf FIXME should be updated when the results are finalized.}
