\section{Information to test the new models}
\label{sect:model}
In the previous sections, a simplified SUSY model was used to optimize the selections and interperet the results. 
Here, the main efficiencies are reported versus the generated values, that can be used to examin the new models approximately in 
a MC generator-level study. The number of the remaining signal events and its uncertainty which can be evaluated by a generator-level study 
should be combined statistically with the results in Tab. \ref{tbl:yieldSysSummary} to find the upper limit on the number of the signal events
and decide if a model is excluded or still allowed in the shoadow of the analysis presented in the paper.

In different channels, the generated tau's are found.
