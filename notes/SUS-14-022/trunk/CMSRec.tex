\section{The CMS detector and event reconstruction}
\label{sect:CMSRec}
The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid of 6\unit{m} internal diameter, providing a magnetic field of 3.8\unit{T}. Within the superconducting solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a barrel and two endcap sections. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Extensive forward calorimetry complements the coverage provided by the barrel and endcap detectors. 
A more detailed description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in reference \cite{Chatrchyan:2008zzk}.
For completeness, a short review is given here. 


Events from pp interactions must satisfy the requirements of a two-level trigger system.
The first level (L1) of the CMS trigger system, composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select the most interesting events in a fixed time interval of less than 4\mus. The high-level trigger (HLT) processor farm further decreases the event rate from around 100\unit{kHz} to around 400\unit{Hz}, before data storage. 

The particle-flow event algorithm~\cite{CMS-PAS-PFT-09-001,CMS-PAS-PFT-10-001} reconstructs and identifies each individual particle with an optimized combination of information from the various elements of the CMS detector. The energy of photons is directly obtained from the ECAL measurement, corrected for zero-suppression effects. The energy of electrons is determined from a combination of the electron momentum at the primary interaction vertex as determined by the tracker, the energy of the corresponding ECAL cluster, and the energy sum of all bremsstrahlung photons spatially compatible with originating from the electron track. The energy of muons is obtained from the curvature of the corresponding track. The energy of charged hadrons is determined from a combination of their momentum measured in the tracker and the matching ECAL and HCAL energy deposits, corrected for zero-suppression effects and for the response function of the calorimeters to hadronic showers. Finally, the energy of neutral hadrons is obtained from the corresponding corrected ECAL and HCAL energy. 

Jets are reconstructed with the anti-\kt clustering
algorithm~\cite{Cacciari:2008gp} with a distance parameter of 0.5. We apply
\pt- and $\eta$-dependent corrections to account for residual
effects of non-uniform detector response~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011ds}.
A correction to account for multiple pp collisions within the same or a nearby
bunch crossing (pileup interactions) is estimated on an event-by-event basis using the
jet-area method described in Ref.~\cite{Cacciari:2007fd}, and is
subtracted from the reconstructed jet \pt.
The combined secondary vertex algorithm is used to identify (``b-tagged'') jets 
originating from b-quarks.  This algorithm 
 is based on the reconstruction of secondary vertices, together with track-based lifetime information~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012jua}. 
In this analysis the "medium" working point is used. The working point corresponds to an average b-tagged jets efficiency of 70\%, 
light-quark jet misidentification rate of 1.5\%, and $\cPqc$-quark jet misidentification rate of 20\% 
for jets with a \pt\ value greater than 60\GeV.
Jets with  \PT $>$ 40 \GeV and $\abs{\eta} < 5.0$ and b-tagged jets with \PT $>$ 20 \GeV and $\abs{\eta} < 2.4$ are considered in this analysis.
% {\bf (Do you really use jets up to 5.0 in eta?)} 


The particles from the particle-flow algorithm are used to reconstruct the missing transverse energy vector $\VEtmiss$, defined as the negative of the vector sum of the transverse momenta of all reconstructed particles.  Corrections are applied to ensure consistency between
$\VEtmiss$ and the corrections to jet energies described above.  The missing transverse energy in the event (\MPT) is defined as the magnitude of $\VEtmiss$.



Hadronically-decaying $\tau$ leptons (\Tau) are reconstructed using the hadron-plus-strips algorithm~\cite{Khachatryan:2015dfa}. The constituents of the reconstructed jets are used to identify individual tau decay modes with one charged hadron and up to two neutral pions, or three charged hadrons. 
Additional discriminators are used to separate \Tau from electrons and muons.
Prompt $\tau$ leptons are expected to be isolated in the detector.
To discriminate them from QCD jets we use a measure of isolation 
based on the charged hadrons, photons, and neutral hadrons falling within 
a cone around the tau momentum direction.  A similar isolation algorithm is 
used in this analysis to separate leptons ($e$ or $\mu$) from tau decay from 
those arising in QCD processes.
