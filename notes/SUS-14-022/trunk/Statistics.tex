Event data yields and background predictions for the four signal regions are summarized in Table~\ref{tbl:yieldSysSummary}.
There is no excess of events over the SM expectation.  We interpret our results in the context
of a simplified model of chargino pair-production and decay, which corresponds to the left
diagram in Fig.~\ref{fig:Productions}.  Combining all four signal regions,
the search rules out \chione of mass up to 410 \GeV and  $\PSGczDo$ of mass up to 100 \GeV,
see Fig.~\ref{fig:limit_final}.

{\bf (You need to spend one sentence to explain what method you are using to set limits.  I assume
  it is CLs, but because I am not sure what you actually did I did not write
  it down.  Also, you
  need to specify whether this is 95\% CL or 90\% CL or whatever).}

{\bf (The description of the simplified model is insufficient.  Surely the cross-section and branching
  ratios depends on the stau mass and/or the sneutrino mass?  It must also make a difference whether
  the stau/sneutrino are on- or off-shell and what their masses are as far as the acceptance
  is concerned.
  Also in Figure 1 left there are two distinct
  decay chains.  What BR are you assuming for the two chains)}

{\bf The caption for the figure is incorrect..it says expected but there is also observed.  The boundaries
  of the plot (diagonal lines) need to be explained.)}
