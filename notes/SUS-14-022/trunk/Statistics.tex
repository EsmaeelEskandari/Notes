\input{YieldSystematic}

Event data yields and background predictions for the four signal regions are summarized in Table~\ref{tbl:yieldSysSummary}.
There is no excess of events over the SM expectation.  We interpret our results in the context
of a simplified model of chargino pair-production and decay, which corresponds to the left
diagram in Fig.~\ref{fig:Productions}. To generate the signal samples, all  \sTau and $\sNu_{\tau}$ 
are produced  on-shell. They have equal masses which are the mean value of the masses of the \chione   and \PSGczDo.
The two distinct decay chains in the left diagram of Fig.~\ref{fig:Productions} are assumed to have equal branching ratios, which is 50\%.

Combining all four signal regions,
the search rules out \chione of mass up to 410 \GeV and  $\PSGczDo$ of mass up to 100 \GeV,
see Fig.~\ref{fig:limit_final}.

%%%%%%%%%%
This is conducted using a modified frequentist approach, namely CLs method \cite{read:CLs} to 
exclude the signal points at 95\% Confidence Level.
The \sTau searches in the LEP experiments \cite{lepsusy} have excluded the masses below 95 \GeV. In Fig.~\ref{fig:limit_final}, 
this region is shown by the line labeled as $m_{\sTau} < 95 GeV$. The diagonal line denotes the boundary for $m_{\chione} = m_{\tau} + m_{LSP}$, which is 
the kinemtical boundary of the search.



%{\bf (You need to spend one sentence to explain what method you are using to set limits.  I assume
%  it is CLs, but because I am not sure what you actually did I did not write
%  it down.  Also, you
%  need to specify whether this is 95\% CL or 90\% CL or whatever).}
%{\bf (The description of the simplified model is insufficient.  Surely the cross-section and branching
%  ratios depends on the stau mass and/or the sneutrino mass?  It must also make a difference whether
%  the stau/sneutrino are on- or off-shell and what their masses are as far as the acceptance
%  is concerned.
%  Also in Figure 1 left there are two distinct
%  decay chains.  What BR are you assuming for the two chains)}
%{\bf The caption for the figure is incorrect..it says expected but there is also observed.  The boundaries
%  of the plot (diagonal lines) need to be explained.)}
