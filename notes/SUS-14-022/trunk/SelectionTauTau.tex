\section{\texorpdfstring{Selection cuts for \Tau\Tau channel}{Selection cuts for Tau-Tau channel}}
\label{sect:tauTauCuts}
The selection of the events from the collisions for different channels 
is done with the dedicated triggers that use the combination of muon, electron 
and tau lepton reconstructed in the trigger levels ~\cite{CMS:2013hoa,Chatrchyan:2012xi,Chatrchyan:2011nv}.

To select the events for \Tau\Tau channel, two reconstructed \Tau which are oppsitlely charged are selected. Both \Tau's are asked to 
have \PT $>$ 45 \GeV and $|\eta| <$ 2.1 and $I_{\Tau}$ less than 1\GeV. In the case of more than one pair, the pair that minimizes the sum of
$I_{\Tau}$ is selected.
The events with extra electrons or muons (\PT $>$ 10 \GeV, $\eta >$ 2.1 and loose isolation criteria) 
are rejected to suppress the contribution of the associatiated production of \Z with vector bosons.

A Monte Carlo (MC) study shows that the invariant mass distribution of the two \Tau's coming from a \Z boson can be approximated with a gaussian 
distribution with a peak close to 70 \GeV and a width of about 15 \GeV, so the events with the invariant mass of  
the two \Tau's in this range are excluded (\Z-veto). A minimum cut of 15 \GeV on this invariant mass helps to get rid of the low mass
QCD resonances. The minimum angle in the transverse plane between the \MET and the jets with \PT $>$ 40 \GeV and $|\eta| <$ 5.0 
is asked to be greater than 1. This is a cut against the QCD multijet events and every event with a fake \MET. A soft cut on 
\mttwo ($>$ 40 \GeV) increases this rejection.

After applying pre-selection cuts, two extra set of cuts are introduced, one aims the regions with large and medium mass difference between 
charginos and neutralinos, the other one is dedicated for low mass regions. The two search bins are chosen to be exclusive in order 
to be able to combine the statistics at the end. When the mass difference is sufficiently high, \mttwo has a tail well beyond 80 \GeV, which is 
the peak  and the end point of the \mt distribution of $W$jets events. The optimized cut for this variable is 90 \GeV. The shift in 
value of the endpoint is Due to the smearing, the endpoint is seen at  90 \GeV.

If the mass diffrenece is not too high, \mttwo can not exceed 80 \GeV, 
but the sum of the \mt of two \Tau (\SumMT = $\mt^{\Tau^1} + \mt^{\Tau^2}$) can be a good descriminator between the signal and SM backgrounds. 
Two bins are defined as:
\begin{itemize}
\item[\binone] \mttwo $>$ 90 \GeV.
\item[\bintwo] \mttwo $<$ 90 \GeV; \SumMT $>$ 250 \GeV; b-tagged jets are vetoed.
\end{itemize}
Vetoing the b-tagged jets in the second bin is useful against the backgrounds containting a top quark, especially \ttbar events. 

The event yields can be found in table~\ref{tbl:cutflowtable}. The yields for three SUSY signal points, 
corresponding to a low mass difference $(m_{\chione}=180\GeV,~m_{\PSGczDo}=60\GeV)$, 
a moderate mass difference $(m_{\chione}=240\GeV,~m_{\PSGczDo}=40\GeV)$ and a high mass difference $(m_{\chione}=380\GeV,~m_{\PSGczDo}=1\GeV)$, are presented in the table.

The distributions of $\mttwo$ and $\SumMT$ after applying pre-selection cuts are shown in figure~\ref{fig:comparison}.
The b-jet veto cut is also applied on the $\SumMT$ distribution. For both plots, the shape of QCD MC events
is taken from same-sign events, which means that same selection cuts as pre-selection are applied except for the charge
requirement which is reversed. Then the distribution of QCD MC events are found from data after non-QCD MC subtraction
in the same-sign region. It can be concluded that data and MC are in reasonable agreement within the statistical uncertainties.
