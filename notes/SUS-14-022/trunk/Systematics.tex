\section{Systematic uncertainties}
\label{sect:sys}
Systematic uncertainties can affect the shape or normalization of the
backgrounds estimated from Monte Carlo, as well as the signal acceptance.
These uncertainties are listed below and summarized in Table~\ref{Tab.SYS}.
\input{SystematicsTab}

\begin{itemize}

\item The uncertainty on the luminosity  is $2.6\%$.  This affects the
  normalization of all Monte Carlo samples.
 
\item  The systematic uncertainties on the muon and electron energy scales
  are negligible.  In the case of \Tau, the visible energy in the Monte Carlo
  is scaled up and down by $3\%$, and all \Tau-related variables are
  recalculated.  The resulting variations in final yields are taken as
  systematic
  uncertainties.  They amount to 25\% for backgrounds and 15\% for signal.
  In the part of the signal phase space which is accessible by the analysis,
  the value is almost constant in different points and a conservative value is selected.
 % {\bf (Doesn't the signal uncertainty depend on the signal point?)}

\item The uncertainty on electron and muon trigger, identification, and
  isolation efficiencies is $2\%$.
%  {\bf (Shoudn't you say how you obtained these?)}

\item The uncertainty on the $\hadtau$ identification efficiency is $6\%$. 
  The uncertainty on the efficiency of the \Tau leg of the $e\hadtau$ and
  $\mu\hadtau$ ($\tauTau$) triggers amount to $3.0\%$ ($4.5\%$ per leg).
  A ``tag-and-probe'' technique on $\cPZ\to \Pgt\Pgt$ events is used to estimate the 
  uncertainties.
%  {\bf (Shoudn't you say how you obtained these?)}

\item To evaluate the uncertainty due to pileup, the assumed inelastic
  pp cross-section is varied by 5\%.  This then changes the number
  of simulated pileup interactions, and changes the relevant acceptance
  to the processes of interest by $~4 \%$.

\item The uncertainty on the signal acceptance due to parton-distribution
  function uncertainties is expected to be small.
  It is about $2\%$ in the similar analysis \cite{Khachatryan:2014qwa}.
%  {\bf (I am not sure you can get away with thise statement in a paper!)}

\item The uncertanty on the signal acceptance associated with initial state
  radiation (ISR) is evaluated by comparing the efficiency of jet-related
  requirements between \PYTHIA and \MADGRAPH which is a matrix element generator 
  for the $WW$ SM process which
  is similar to chargino pair-production.  From these studies we estimate
  a 3\% uncertainty on the bveto efficiency and a 6\% uncertainty on the
  $\Delta \Phi$ requirement.
  The ISR uncertainty is not considered for the background samples, due to the
  usage of  matrix element  generators.
%  {\bf (This is not correct.  First of all Madgraph is not NLO, it is
%    only partly NLO.  Second, we have a prescription in the SUSY group on how
%    to reweight and/or assign a systematic due to the modeling of
%    the \ttbar transverse momentum)}

\end{itemize}

%\noindent {\bf What about the btag uncertainty from the btag group?  What about the uncertainty associated with \MET resolution and tails that would throw some of your SM backgrounds like \ttbar or WW into the MT2 tail?  What about the uncertainties on the normalization of the cross-sections for the backgrounds that you take from Monte Carlo?}
\item The main backgrounds come from data driven or MC validated against data. \MET uncertainties can be important for signal only. Our signal is produced through an SUSY EWK production and does not include jets directly but it is expected to feature four invisible particles as genuine missing energy. Therefore it should not be affected by jet calibrations. Apart from jets, lepton and tau energy scales and their effects on \MET have been already taken into account. There is just unclustered energy left which based on results in ~\cite{CMS_AN_2014-099} this item's effect on \MET is small enough enough to be ignored.



\noindent We add all systematic uncertainties in quadrature, resulting  
in 20\% and 25\% relative uncertainties on the signal
acceptance and the Monte Carlo background predictions, respectively.
