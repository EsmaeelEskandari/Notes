% >> Date
% The date is in yyyy/mm/dd format. Today has been
% redefined to match, but if the date needs to be fixed, please write it in this fashion.
% For papers and PAS, \today is taken as the date the head file (this one) was last modified according to svn: see the RCS Id string above.
% For the final version it is best to "touch" the head file to make sure it has the latest date.\date{\today}

% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. For PASs: **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: CDS MathJax processor used on the abstract doesn't understand them _and_ will only look within $$. The abstracts for papers are hand formatted so macros are okay.
\abstract{
 A search for SUSY in chargino pair production is performed when the charginos, $\chipm$, decay to a $\tau$ lepton, neutrino, $\nu_\tau$, 
 and neutralino, $\PSGczDo$. Different final states use 18.1 to 19.6  \fbinv  of proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 8\TeV.
 At least one of the $\tau$ leptons is required to decay hadronically.
 $\mttwo$ of two leptons is used as a search variable to distinguish between signal and background. 
 In a special part of the phase space with a moderate $\mttwo$, the sum of the transverse  
 mass of two $\tau$ leptons was found to be a useful variable. 
%In different bins of the search,  no significant excess is seen with respect to the standard model prediction, so 95\% confidence level limits are set on the masses of the lightest chargino and neutralino. In the context of the simplified models, charginos lighter than XXX and neutralinos below YYYY are excluded at 95\% confidence level.
In different signal regions, 
 no significant excess is seen with respect to the standard model prediction, so 
 upper limits are set on the masses of the lightest chargino and neutralino.
 In the context of the simplified models, charginos lighter than 420 \GeV when the neutralino mass is zero
 are excluded at 95\% confidence level.

% >> PDF Metadata
% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text:
% (1) no TeX! -- for \sqrt{s} use sqrt(s) -- this will show with extra quote marks in the draft version but is okay).
% (2) no %.
% (3) No curly braces {}.
