\subsection{\texorpdfstring{QCD Background Estimation in $\tauTau$ Channel}{QCD Background Estimation in tau-tau Channel}}
In QCD multi-jet events all tau candidates are misidentified jets. Due to the large cross
section and
the poor MC modeling of the tau misidentification rate from jets, the QCD multi-jet contribution in the signal region 
is estimated from data using an ABCD method.
This method relies on different distributions of QCD
in the four exclusive regions labeled as A, B, C (the control regions) and D (the signal region) which are defined in a two-dimensional plane as a function of uncorrelated discriminating variables.
Then the number of QCD events in signal region D can be calculated from the number of QCD events in the control region A multiplied by a transfer factor which is defined as the ratio of the number of QCD events in the control region C to the number of QCD events in control region B $(T=C/B)$.\\
The two discriminating variables used to define regions A, B, C and D are the isolation 
variable and a kinematic variable chosen as \mttwo in search \binone or \SumMT in search \bintwo.  
The definitions of the control regions are summarized in table~\ref{2QCDbg}. \\

\end{table}
\\The number of QCD multi-jet events in the control regions is estimated from data after subtraction 
of other SM contributions estimated from MC simulation. The distribution of the transfer factor as a 
function of the search variable is shown in figure~\ref{fig:1QCDbg}. The correlation 
between the two variables used to define the four exclusive regions is marginal, since the ratio plots can be fitted with a straight line using a $pol0$ function. The fit function is also shown in the plots.\\

\label{fig:1QCDbg}
\end{figure}

In order to increase the contributions from QCD events, the cut on the $\mindphifour>1$ is removed.
To consider the effect of this cut, a cut efficiency should be taken into account. The 
fraction of QCD events with all selection cuts with respect to the QCD events with all selection 
cuts but the $\mindphifour>1$ are shown in figure~\ref{fig:3QCDbg}.\\

\end{figure}

The value of the cut efficiency 
in the last bin has been used to estimation the 
QCD background events in both of search bins. %While for the right plot, the distribution is fitted with a $pol1$ function to 
%take into account the fluctuations of the cut efficiencies in the first few bins. Then the cut efficiency extracted from 
%t%his plot is simply defined as the evaluation of the fit function at $\SumMT=250$. [{\bf FIXME} update this with comments from SUSY meeting] It should be noted that, performing such a 
%$pol1$% fit function on the left plot would yield to a negative value for the cut efficiency and then it was decided to  
%take the value in the last bin as a conservative estimate of the cut efficiency which is used in the final QCD background estimation results. 
The results of the ABCD method are summarized in table~\ref{4QCDbg}. Various sources of uncertainty are considered 
 to determine the QCD background: a statistic uncertainty, systematic uncertainty
For the nonQCD(MC) events and the uncertainty in fitting transfer factor and $\mindphifour$ efficiency. statistic uncertainty are related to data,
systematic uncertainty on the MC events when they are subtracted from data is considred  
to be 25\% of the central value and added in quadrature to the                           
statistical errors.fit uncertainty 
 is obtainted by comparing our fit model, when pol0 fit (last bin) is used for transfer
factor $(\mindphifour)$, with another fit model. therefore model fitting uncertainty is equivalent to  relative difference between 
the central value of QCD events in signal region and weighted mean value. weighted mean value is computed 
as 
\begin{equation}
{\rm Weighted~mean~value} =\frac{\Sigma N_{QCD}/E_{QCD}}{\Sigma 1/E_{QCD}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
{\rm Fit~unceratainty} ={\rm Weighted~mean~value}-{\rm the~central~value~of~QCD~events~in~SR}
\end{equation}

Where
$N_{QCD}$ and $E_{QCD}$ are defined as the number of QCD events and 
  the error on number of QCD events in signal region respectivity.
