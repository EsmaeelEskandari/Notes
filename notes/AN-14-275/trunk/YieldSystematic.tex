\caption{Data yields and background predictions with uncertainties in the four signal regions of the search. 
%The first two lines are based on Monte Carlo simulation, when for the first row, a validation against data is also done. 
%The last two rows are data driven, but the ``Fake'' for the \tauTau channel is not completely data driven.
%The uncertainties are systematic, unless when there are two parts, the first part is statistics.
The uncertainties are reported in two parts, which are statistics and systematic uncertainty, respectively. 
%For \wjets in \tauTau channel, the full uncertainty is
%reported and considered as systematic for ``SM Total''.
The main backgrounds (\wjets and QCD multijet) are derived from data as described in Section~\ref{sect:bkg}.
``VV'' is a shorthand for diboson events.
