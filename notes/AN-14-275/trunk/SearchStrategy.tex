\section{Search Strategy}
\label{sect:search}
In this analysis, two leptons are created with two missing particles, so \mttwo can be a good descriminator to separate signal 
from the SM backgrounds that leptons are produced from $W$ or $Z$ boson. When the mass difference between the chargino and neutralino 
is suffuciently large, \mttwo can exceed 80 GeV which is the maxmimum of the \mt of a lepton which comes from the decay of a $W$ boson.
When the mass difference is not sufficiently large, $SumMT$ which is defined as $\mt_{Lep1} + \mt_{Lep2}$ can be useful to distinguish between the 
signal and SM background.
