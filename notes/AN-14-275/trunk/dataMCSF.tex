\subsection{Monte Carlo to data Corrections}
\label{sec:scaleFactors}
In order to improve the modeling of the data, corrections that follow are
 applied  to Monte Carlo simulated events:
\begin{itemize}
\item $e$, $\mu$, \Tau trigger efficiency
\item $e$, $\mu$ identification and isolation efficiency
\item \Tau energy scale
%\item \MET resolution and response
\item btag efficiency and mistag rate
\item rate of $e$ $\rightarrow$ \Tau  fakes.
\end{itemize}

Trigger is just applied to data. In order to compensate the difference between data and MC simulated events, trigger efficiencies are measured. Measured trigger efficiencies are fitted by integral of a Crystalball function and used to determine trigger scale factors. Then
trigger scale factors  are applied to MC simulated  events.
\\
 $e$, $\mu$  and \Tau trigger efﬁciencies in l$\tau_{had}$ channels are discribed in section 9 of\cite{CMS_AN_2013-171}  and are listed in tables 12 to 15 of the same as [19].
\Tau trigger efﬁciencies in $\tau_{had}\tau_{had}$ channel are given in the table 18 of \cite{CMS_AN_2013-011}
 
Further details about correction factors can be Found  in  \cite{CMS_AN_2013-171} and \cite{HiggsTauTautwiki}.
