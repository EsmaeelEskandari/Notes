\subsection{Monte Carlo to data Corrections}
\label{sec:scaleFactors}
In order to improve the modeling of the data, corrections that follow are
 applied  to Monte Carlo simulated events:
\begin{itemize}
\item $e$, $\mu$, \Tau trigger efficiency
\item $e$, $\mu$ identiﬁcation and isolation efﬁciency
\item \Tau energy scale
%\item \MET resolution and response
\item b–tag efﬁciency and mistag rate
\item rate of $e$ $\rightarrow$ \Tau  fakes.
\end{itemize}
Further details about correction factors  are given in \cite{CMS_AN_2013-171} and \cite{HiggsTauTautwiki}.
