\subsection{Monte Carlo to data Corrections}
\label{sec:scaleFactors}
In order to improve the modeling of the data, corrections that follow are
 applied  to Monte Carlo simulated events:

$\bullet$ ele, $\mu$,$\tau$ trigger efficiency

$\bullet$ ele, $\mu$ identiﬁcation and isolation efﬁciency

$\bullet$ $\hadtau$ energy scale

$\bullet$ \MET resolution and response

$\bullet$ b–tag efﬁciency and mistag rate

$\bullet$ rate of ele $\rightarrow$ \hadtau  fakes.

Further details about correction factors  are given in \cite{} and on the twiki\cite{}.
