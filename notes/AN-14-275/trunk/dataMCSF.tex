\subsection{Monte Carlo to data corrections}
\label{sec:scaleFactors}
In order to improve the modeling of the data, corrections that follow are
 applied  to Monte Carlo simulated events:
\begin{itemize}
\item $e$, $\mu$, \Tau trigger efficiency
\item $e$, $\mu$ identification and isolation efficiency
\item \Tau energy scale
%\item \MET resolution and response
\item btag efficiency and mistag rate
\item rate of $e$ $\rightarrow$ \Tau  fakes.
\end{itemize}
For the selections which are applied on both MC and data, the ratio of efficiencies measured in data to the Monte Carlo expectation is applied as scale factors to MC events, but for the trigger which is applied only on data, the MC is corrected by the efficiency of the trigger in the data.
%Trigger is just applied to data. In order to compensate the differences between data and MC simulated events, 
%Trigger efficiencies are measured in data. Measured trigger efficiencies are fitted by integral of a Crystal-ball function and used as
%the scale factors for MC events. 
The trigger efficiencies of $e$, $\mu$ and \Tau leg in $\ell\Tau$ channels are described in section 9 of \cite{CMS_AN_2013-171}  and are listed in 
tables 12 to 15 of the same reference. The trigger efficiencies of the \Tau legs in $\Tau\Tau$ channel are modelled with an error function. 
The parameters can be found in the \cite{HiggsTauTautwiki}.
 
Further details about correction factors can be found  in   \cite{HiggsTauTautwiki} and  \cite{CMS_AN_2013-171}.
