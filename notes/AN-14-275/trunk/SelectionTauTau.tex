\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$\tauTau$ channel}{tau-tau channel}}
\label{sect:tauTauCuts}
In the final state with 2 hadronic taus, events are required to pass the following list of cuts
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{2 $\boldsymbol\tau_h$ Selection} At least two reconstructed opposite-sign tau objects, 
with $\pt>45\GeV$ and $|\eta|<2.1$, are required. Since the online trigger cuts require two taus with 
$\pt>35\GeV$, there is an offline cut on $\pt>45\GeV$ to get closer to the plateau of the trigger efficiency. 
Both taus not only are required to pass \emph{MediumCombinedIsoDBSumPtCorr3Hits} isolation requirement, 
but also should pass the Loose working point of the MVA3 anti-e discriminator, being \emph{LooseElectronMVA3Rejection}, 
as well as the Loose working point of the Muon2 anti-$\mu$ discriminator, being \emph{LooseMuon2Rejection}. 
In order to reject low mass QCD resonances, the invariant mass of two taus is required to be above 15 \GeV. Also a loose cut on \MPT $>$ 30 \GeV is applied to suppress QCD events.
\item \textbf{\MPT $>$ 30 \GeV} A soft cut is applied on the missing transverse momentum to suppress the QCD multijet events. 
The \MPT related variables which are introduced later, need a minimum value for \MPT to be meaningful. 
\item \textbf{$\boldsymbol e$ and $\boldsymbol\mu$ Veto} Extra electrons and muons are vetoed. This 
cut would help to reject backgrounds from di-boson events. Electron and muon rejection 
are exactly the same as in $\mu\Tau$ channel which is described in Sec.~\ref{sect:leptonTauCuts}.
\item \textbf{Z Veto} Events under the reconstructed Z mass peak are rejected, namely $|m_{\tau\tau}-m_{\Z}^{\rm rec}|>15\GeV$. 
In the reconstructed $\Z\rightarrow \Tau\Tau$ events passing above-mentioned set of cuts, events under the Z mass peak are fitted 
with a Gaussian function. The mean value of the fit is found to be about 70 \GeV. Hence the invariant mass of two taus, $m_{\tau\tau}$, should be 
either below 55 \GeV or above 85 \GeV.  
\item \textbf{$\boldsymbol\mindphifour > $ 1} The minimum angle in the transverse plane between the \MPT and the jets with \PT $>$ 40 \GeV and $|\eta| <$ 5 is asked to be greater than 1. This cut is introduced against multi-jet events.
\item \textbf{$\boldsymbol\mttwo>40\GeV$} Since SM background events with low \MPT or fake \MPT arising from miss-measured reconstructed object
 contribute to the lower values of $\mttwo$, then a moderate cut on this variable would improve data over MC ratio.  
\end{itemize}
After applying preselection cuts, two extra set of cuts are introduced, where each of them is sensitive to some regions of $\chione\PSGczDo$ mass plane: one aims the regions with large mass difference between charginos and neutralinos, the other one is dedicated for low mass-difference regions. It should be noted that the two signal regions ({\bf SR}) are chosen to be exclusive in order to be able to combine the statistics at the end.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf \binone: sensitive to high $\boldsymbol\Delta m$}
A first set of cuts includes a cut on $\mttwo$.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mttwo>90\GeV$.
\end{itemize}
\item {\bf \bintwo: sensitive to low $\boldsymbol\Delta m$}
A second set of cuts includes some cuts on different variables listed below.
\begin{itemize}
\item bjets tagged with CSVM algorithm are vetoed.
\item $\mttwo<90\GeV$;
\item $\SumMT>250\GeV$;
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\SumMT = $\mt^{\Tau^1} + \mt^{\Tau^2}$, is a good discriminator
between signal and SM backgrounds in \bintwo. 
This variable was used previously in a similar analysis from the ATLAS experiment \cite{Aad:2014yka}.

The cut-flow-table can be found in table~\ref{tbl:cutflowtable}. The yields for three SUSY signal points, corresponding to a low mass difference $(m_{\chione}=180\GeV,m_{\PSGczDo}=60\GeV)$, a moderate mass difference $(m_{\chione}=240\GeV,m_{\PSGczDo}=40\GeV)$ and a high mass difference $(m_{\chione}=380\GeV,m_{\PSGczDo}=1\GeV)$, are presented in the table.

The distributions of $\mttwo$ and $\SumMT$ just before applying the final cut on the search variable 
are shown in figure~\ref{fig:comparison}. 
%The b-jet veto cut is also applied on the $\SumMT$ distribution. 
For both plots, the shape of QCD MC events 
is taken from same-sign events, which means that same selection cuts as pre-selection are applied except for the charge 
requirement which is reversed. Then the distribution of QCD MC events are found from data after non-QCD MC subtraction 
in the same-sign region. It can be concluded that data and MC are in reasonable agreement within the statistical uncertainties.
