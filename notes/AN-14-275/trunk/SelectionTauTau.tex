\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$\tauTau$ Channel}{tau-tau Channel}}
\label{sect:tauTauCuts}
%In the context of MSSM, supersymmetric objects are produced in pairs to conserve R-parity quantum number. Therefore in the production of charginos from proton-proton collisions, one may consider the following interaction $$pp\rightarrow\PSGcpDo\PSGcmDo\rightarrow\sTau^{+}\nu_\tau \sTau^{-}\nu_\tau\rightarrow\tau^{+}\PSGczDo\nu_\tau\tau^{-}\PSGczDo\nu_\tau\rightarrow\tau^{+}\tau^{-} + 2\,\PSGczDo + 2\,\nu_\tau.$$ In the detector, what can be observed are only 2 tau leptons plus missing transverse energy from the presence of neturinos and neutralinos in the final state.\\
%The tau leptons can decay leptonically, in 35\% of the time, or can decay via hadrons, which is occuring with 65\% of probability. Since there are two leptons in the final state, then the probability of having $\PSGcpDo\PSGcmDo \rightarrow \hadtau+e/\mu+\MET$ is about 46\%, while the probability of occuring $\PSGcpDo\PSGcmDo \rightarrow \hadtau+\hadtau+\MET$ is about 42\%. Hereafter, final states containing a lepton are referred to as $\leptonTau$ channel and those events where the two taus decays via hadrons are referred to as $\tauTau$. This section describes the cuts to enhance $\tauTau$ events. The list of cuts to select the $\leptonTau$ events can be found in Section~\ref{sect:leptonTauCuts}.\\    
In the final state with 2 hadronic taus, events are required to pass the following list of cuts
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{2 $\boldsymbol\tau_h$ Selection} At least two reconstructed opposite-sign tau objects, 
with $\pt>45\GeV$ and $|\eta|<2.1$, are required. Since the online trigger cuts require two taus with 
$\pt>35\GeV$, there is an offline cut on $\pt>45\GeV$ to get closer to the plateau of the trigger efficiency. 
Both taus not only are required to pass \emph{MediumCombinedIsoDBSumPtCorr3Hits} isolation requirement, 
but also should pass the Loose working point of the MVA3 anti-e discriminator, being \emph{LooseElectronMVA3Rejection}, 
as well as the Loose working point of the Muon2 anti-$\mu$ discriminator, being \emph{LooseMuon2Rejection}. 
In order to reject low mass QCD resonances, the invariant mass of two taus is required to be above 15 GeV. 
\item \textbf{$\boldsymbol e$ and $\boldsymbol\mu$ Veto} Extra electrons and muons are vetoed. This 
cut would help to reject backgrounds from di-boson events. Electron and muon rejection 
are exactly the same as in $\mu\Tau$ channel which is described in Sec.~\ref{sect:leptonTauCuts}.
\item \textbf{Z Veto} Events under the reconstructed Z mass peak are rejected, namely $|m_{\tau\tau}-m_{\Z}^{\rm rec}|>15\GeV$. 
In the reconstructed $\Z\rightarrow \Tau\Tau$ events passing above-mentioned set of cuts, events under the Z mass peak are fitted 
with a Gaussian function. The mean value of the fit is found to be about 70 GeV. Hence the invariant mass of two taus, $m_{\tau\tau}$, should be 
either below 55 GeV or above 85 GeV.  
\item \textbf{$\boldsymbol\mindphifour > $ 1} This cut is introduced against multi-jet events.  
\item \textbf{$\boldsymbol\mttwo>40\GeV$} Since SM background events with low \MET or fake \MET arrising from miss-measured reconstructed object
 contribute to the lower values of $\mttwo$, then a moderate cut on this variable would improve data over MC ratio.  
\end{itemize}
After applying pre-selection cuts, two extra set of cuts are introduced, where each of them is sensitive to some regions of $\chione\PSGczDo$ mass plane: one aimed the regions with large mass difference between charginos and neutralinos, the other one is dedicated for low mass-difference regions. It should be noted that the two search bins are chosen to be exclusive in order to be able to combine the statistics at the end.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Search \binone: sensitive to high $\boldsymbol\Delta m$}
A first set of cuts includes a cut on $\mttwo$.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mttwo>90\GeV$.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Search \bintwo: sensitive to low $\boldsymbol\Delta m$}
A second set of cuts includes some cuts on different variables listed below.
\begin{itemize}
\item b-jets tagged with CSVM algorithm are vetoed.
\item $\mttwo<90\GeV$;
\item $\SumMT>250\GeV$;
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
The cut-flow-table can be found in table~\ref{tbl:cutflowtable}. The yields for three SUSY signal points, corresponding to a low mass difference $(m_{\chione}=180\GeV,m_{\PSGczDo}=60\GeV)$, a moderate mass difference $(m_{\chione}=240\GeV,m_{\PSGczDo}=40\GeV)$ and a high mass difference $(m_{\chione}=380\GeV,m_{\PSGczDo}=1\GeV)$, are presented in the table.

The distributions of $\mttwo$ and $\SumMT$ after applying pre-selection cuts are shown in figure~\ref{fig:comparison}. There is only one QCD event with slightly large weight contributing to the plots. Hence the disagreement between data and MC in a couple of bins of $\SumMT$ distribution can be justified. In order to be blind to data, in both distributions data events are not shown at some points. Overally, it can be concluded that data and MC are in reasonable agreement.
