\subsection{Electron}
Electron identification is based on a MVA (Boosted Decision Tree) method ~\cite{Hocker:2007ht} which its training takes care of cleaning of electrons collection from jet\,$\rightarrow e$  fakes. The training process takes advantage of two bins of $\pt$ and three bins of $\eta$, running over a sample of $Z \rightarrow ee$  events selected in data. Those oppositely charged electrons pair closest to Z-boson peak mass is taken as "signal" and the other electron candidates as "background". The training input variables are described in ~\cite{CMS_AN_2013-188}. Different discriminators is trained on electrons which pass the criteria of single electron trigger and for an inclusive sample of electrons, which the second one is chosen.
According to the BDT output,it can be defined a loose and tight working points for an electron in different bins of $\pt$ and $\eta$ which is given in Table ~\ref{Tab.electronMVAIDwp}.

To reject those electrons which is coming from photon conversions, it is required that the electron touches all layers of Pixel detector. Furthermore if there is an oppositely charged track near electron which is fitted to a common vertex inside of tracker volume that electron is rejected. 
\subsection{Muon}
Muons are required to be reconstructed by the Tracker or the Global muon reconstruction algorithm and to be identified as 
muons by tight particle flow algorithm.

The particle flow algorithm identifies  muons by separating them in several steps.


$\bullet$ The number of pixel hit(s) associated to muon track\,$\geq $\,1

$\bullet$ Number of tracker layers with hits should be $\geq $\,6

$\bullet$ The number of hits in muon system $\geq $\,1

$\bullet$ Tracker track matched with at least one muon segment (in any station)

$\bullet$ $\chi ^{2}/{\rm NDF} $ for the global track fit\,$< $\,10 ,

$\bullet$ Impact parameter constrains between the muon track and the selected primary vertex 
 $d_{z} < $\,0.5 cm and $d_{0} <$\,0.2 cm.

\subsection{Muon and electron isolation}

In order to reduce the background contributions from QCD multiâ€“jet events, electrons and
muons are required to be isolated. The isolation is computed as the $\pt$ sum of charged particles (including charged hadrons, 
electrons and muons), neutral hadrons plus photons reconstructed by the PF algorithm within a cone of size
$\Delta R_{\rm iso}$ = 0.4 around the direction of the muon respectively electron. 

In the innermost region
(``veto cone'') neutral
hadrons and photons  are excluded from the computation of the isolation $\pt$ sum in order to prevent energy deposits in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. Charged particles close to the direction of electrons  are excluded too in order to avoid tracks due to conversions of photons emitted by Bremsstrahlung processes to spoil the isolation.

For the muon isolation the photon and neutral hadron candidates are required to have a transverse energy of $\MET>0.5\,\GeV$. This reduces pile-up effects. The correction of pile-up to isolation is done by applying $\Delta\beta$ corrections.
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:muonisolation1}
I_{e/ \mu}\,=\,\Sigma\, \pt^{\rm charged }(\Delta z <2\,mm)+max(\pt^{\rm photon}+\pt^{h0 }-\Delta \beta,0),
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath}
The $\Delta\beta$ corrections are computed by summing the transverse momenta of charged particles
that have longitudinal impact parameters $\Delta z > 2$ mm with respect to the lepton production
vertex and scaling the sum by a factor 0.5:
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:muonisolation2}
\Delta\beta\,=\,0.5\, \Sigma \pt^{\rm charged }(\Delta z <2mm).
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Hadronic $\tau$}{Hadronic tau}} 
\label{sec:hadTau}
The "Hadron plus Strip" (HPS) algorithm~\cite{2012JInst...7.1001C} is employed to reconstruct the hadronic decays of $\tau$ leptons with the jet constituents as input. The algorithm is seeded by PF jets reconstructed using the anti-$k_{\rm T}$ procedure with a distance parameter of $R=0.5$. To discriminate against quark and gluon jets, jets with extra particles not compatible with the hadronic $\tau$ decays are rejected. Additional criteria are used to suppress the contributions from electrons and muons in the hadronic $\tau$ ($\hadtau$) collection.

Based on the expected particles in the final state of the hadronic $\tau$ decay, different combinations of charged hadrons and $\pi^0$ candidates are considered. The $\pi^0 (\to\gamma\gamma)$ candidates are reconstructed using PF photons with $\pt>2.5\,\GeV$, falling into $\eta-\phi$ "strips" with specific size~\cite{CMS_AN_2013-171}. While a \textbf{single charged hadron} is an indication of $\tau^{\pm}\to\pi^{\pm}\nu_{\tau}$, a combination of \textbf{three charged hadrons} fulfilling a set of requirements are considered as the process of $\tau^{\pm}\to a_1^{\pm}\nu_{\tau}\to\pi^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}\pi^{\pm}\nu_{\tau}$. \textbf{One charged hadron plus two Strips} with a dedicated selection is assigned to $\tau^{\pm}\to a_1^{\pm}\nu_{\tau}\to\pi^{\pm}\pi^{0}\pi^{0}\nu_{\tau}$ decays. Finally the signature of  $\tau^{\pm}\to\rho^{\pm}\nu_{\tau}\to\pi^{\pm}\pi^{0}\nu_{\tau}$ decay is searched for in \textbf{one charged hadron plus one Strip} combinations. All charged hadrons and strips in the $\tau$ decay mode reconstruction must be within a narrow cone around the jet axis where the cone size depends on the $\tau$ jet $\pt$. Details on specific selections for each category as well as the $\pt$ dependence of the cone size can be found in Ref.~\cite{CMS_AN_2013-171}

The isolation variable is defined as the sum of the $\pt$ of charged hadrons and the $\et$ of photons within a cone of $\Delta R = 0.5$ around the $\hadtau$ axis. Particles used to reconstruct the $\hadtau$ candidate are excluded. The contribution of pile-up to the $\Tau$ isolation is accounted for by applying the so-called $\Delta\beta$ corrections. The selection criteria for charged hadrons in the isolation sum together with the pile-up subtraction procedure can be found in Ref.~\cite{CMS_AN_2013-171}. The Loose, Medium and Tight working points correspond to isolation variables less than 2.0, 1.0 and 0.8\,$\GeV$, respectively.

The $\hadtau$ candidates are vetoed if signals exist in the muon system close to the $\hadtau$ direction. Loose, Medium and Tight working points are provided, corresponding to different $\hadtau$ identification efficiencies and $\mu\to\hadtau$ fake rates~\cite{CMS_AN_2013-171}. To discriminate against electrons i.e., rejecting $e\to\hadtau$ fakes, a multivariate discriminator is trained for which the Loose, Medium, Tight and very-Tight working points are defined based on the outputs of 16 different BDT's. Each BDT is associated to a category of $\hadtau$ candidates where the classification of $\hadtau$'s is performed according to their kinematics and decay mode as well as their closeness to a GSF electron. The working points are optimized to achieve the lowest $e\to\tau$ rate possible with a given $\hadtau$ identification efficiency~\cite{CMS_AN_2012-417}.

\subsection{Jet and MET reconstruction}
\label{sec:jetmet}
Particle flow algorithm is used to reconstruct jets and \ETmiss. The medium working point of the Combined Secondary Vertex algorithm is used to tag b-jets.

The minimum $\Delta\phi$ between \ETmiss and jets, hereafter referred to as \mindphifour, is used in this analysis to suppress QCD events. To calculate \mindphifour, all the pf-jets in $|\eta|<5.0$ region and with $\pt>40\GeV$ are used without applying any extra identification. $\mindphifour > 1.0$ is found useful for this analysis.
