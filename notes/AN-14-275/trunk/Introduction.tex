\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:introduction}

Supersymmetry \cite{Martin:1997ns} (SUSY) is one of the most promising extensions of the 
Standard Model of the elementary particles (SM) which solves both the 
quadratic divergencies and hierarchy problems simultaneously. It introduces a new symmetry between the bosons and fermions and 
for every particle a sparticle is defined which is exactly the same, but differ in spin by 1/2. 
%Since the super particles are not discovered yet, the supersymmetry should be a broken symmetry. 
%Various mechanisms are introduced to break the symmetry softly without changing the other interesting features of the theory.

In a hadron collider, like LHC, it is expected to see the signature of the coloured SUSY partners, 
but the very extensive search in the LHC experiments pushes the mass of the coloured particles much 
beyond the previous expectations. 
Looking at other sectors of the SUSY, e.g, electroweak production of the sparticles, is motivated not to miss SUSY in a corner.
A search for new physics using 20 $\fbinv$ of data from CMS taken in 2012 is documented in this note. 
Although the search is sensitive to any high scale 
new physics with a missing transverse momentum, an R-parity conserving SUSY model is used 
to illustrate the performance of the method.

Due to the special role of the third generation of the sparticles, events with two taus in the final state 
accompanying with the missing transverse energy (\MET) are considered.
The two taus can be generated in the cascade of the staus or charginos:
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation}
p + p \rightarrow \PSGcpDo +\PSGcmDo ~~\mathrm{or}~~  p + p \rightarrow \sTau + \sTau
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath}
when 
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation}
\PSGcpDo \rightarrow \sTau + \nu ~~\mathrm{or}~~  \PSGcpDo \rightarrow \sNu_{\tau} + \tau 
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath}
and 
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation}
\sTau \rightarrow \tau + \PSGczDo ~~\mathrm{or}~~  \sNu_{\tau} \rightarrow \nu + \PSGczDo 
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath}
and $\PSGczDo$ can not be detected and appears as missing transverse momentum (\MET).
In this note, we mainly focus on the $\PSGcpDo\PSGcmDo$ production which has a higher 
production cross section. Figure \ref{fig:Productions} shows our favourite decays.

In the context of MSSM, supersymmetric objects are produced in pairs to conserve R-parity quantum number. Therefore in the production of charginos from proton-proton collisions, one may consider the following interaction $$pp\rightarrow\PSGcpDo\PSGcmDo\rightarrow\sTau^{+}\nu_\tau \sTau^{-}\nu_\tau\rightarrow\tau^{+}\PSGczDo\nu_\tau\tau^{-}\PSGczDo\nu_\tau\rightarrow\tau^{+}\tau^{-} + 2\,\PSGczDo + 2\,\nu_\tau.$$ In the detector, what can be observed are only 2 tau leptons plus missing transverse energy from the presence of neturinos and neutralinos in the final state.\\ 
The tau leptons can decay leptonically, in 35\% of the time, or can decay via hadrons, which is occurring with 65\% of probability. Since there are two leptons in the final state, then the probability of having $\PSGcpDo\PSGcmDo \rightarrow \hadtau+e/\mu+\MET$ is about 46\%, while the probability of occurring $\PSGcpDo\PSGcmDo \rightarrow \hadtau+\hadtau+\MET$ is about 42\%. Hereafter, final states containing a lepton are referred to as $\leptonTau$ channel and those events where the two taus decays via hadrons are referred to as $\tauTau$. The selction cuts to enhance $\tauTau$ events will be discussed in Section~\ref{sect:tauTauCuts}. The list of cuts to select $\leptonTau$ events can be found in Section~\ref{sect:leptonTauCuts}.\\     

The search variable is the stransverse mass (\mttwo) which is the natural extension of the known transverse mass (\mt) to a case 
when two massive particles with equal mass are created in pairs and decay via a chain of jets and leptons to two 
invisible particles. 
In the case of R-Parity conserving SUSY, the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP) escapes the detection and appears as 
a missing transverse momentum.
The distribution of \mttwo reflects the scale of the produced particles and is much higher for sparticles
compared to the SM particles. Hence, SUSY should appear as an excess in the tail of the \mttwo distribution.
It was shown previously \cite{MT2_2011} that \mttwo is a powerful variable to search for SUSY. 


After introduction in the next section the \mttwo variable is introduced.
